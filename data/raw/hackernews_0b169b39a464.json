These five real vulnerabilities, uncovered by Intruder's  bug-hunting team, reveal how attackers turn overlooked flaws into serious security incidents.  1. Stealing AWS Credentials with a Redirect   Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) is a common vulnerability that can have a significant impact, especially in cloud-hosted applications. If a web application fetches resources from user-supplied URLs, care should be taken to ensure attackers can't manipulate requests to access unintended resources.
